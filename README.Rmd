"HelperFunctions.R" is a set of simple functions, including the expit function, the deviation of the expit function, the normal kernel function, the time-dependent covariate function, the cross-validation split function, the normalization function. I have also annotated in the R program.

"Supervised_est.R" is the supervised method to estimate the survival function for the three different types of data, and for the combination estimation.

"NewtonCLseh.R" is the optimization algorithm to estimate the intrinsic estimator for beta. 

"Beta_estimate.R" is used to estimate semi-supervised estimator for beta, and to calculate the intrinsic estimator for beta by using the optimization algorithm.

"CV_function.R" is the cross-validation method to estimate the survival function and variance of the intrinsic method of the the three different types of data, respectively. Also for calculating the semi-supervised combination estimator and the intrinsic combination estimator.

"IntrSSL_est_ind.R: is utilized to obtain the intrinsic survival estimator at each fixed time point.

"d011.R" is the self-consistent method to estimate the survival function at each fixed time point, from the "dblcens" R package.

"Cox-SP-AFT.R" is the Cox-SP-AFT method to estimate the survival function and the bootstrap variance at each fixed time point, described in the paper A new semi-supervised learning model combined with Cox and SP-AFT models in cancer survival analysis. Chai et al.".

"Generatemimicreal.R" is used to generate the simulation data, which mimic real data.

"GenerateCoxbtcor67.R", "GenerateCoxbtcor8.R", and "GenerateCoxtcor8.R" are used to generate the simulation data where the model for the survival time is a Cox model with time-dependent covariates and varying correlation between T and T*.

"Generatelogtcor67.R", "Generatelogtcor81.R", and "Generatelogbtcor8.R" are used to generate the simulation data where the model for the survival time is a logistic model with time-dependent covariates and varying correlation between T and T*. 

“example_mimic.R” is an example of the proposed estimation, supervised estimation, and existing self-consistent estimation using the data that mimic real data.

“example_t.R” is an example of the proposed estimation, supervised estimation, and existing self-consistent estimation using data with time-dependent covariates.

“example_bt.R” is an example of the proposed estimation, supervised estimation, and existing self-consistent estimation using data with both time-dependent covariates and time-independent covariates.
